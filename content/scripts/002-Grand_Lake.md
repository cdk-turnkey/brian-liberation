# Brian and friends go to Grand Lake, Oklahoma

One summer, Brian and his friends, family, and {{ a type of companion (plural) // pets // I am going to bring my // consiglieres }} took a trip to Grand Lake, Oklahoma. They all needed a vacation because {{ a reason people needed a vacation // they were tired // They took a vacation because _. // they love raging }}.

Brian loves to play {{ a game // chess //  // quidditch }}, so his friends {{ a nickname for a sly man // Sly Fry //  // Sly Guy }} and {{ a nickname for a merry man // Happy Dude //  // Friendly }}, who were flying in from {{ a faraway place // Mars //  // the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter }}, decided to cram the {{ unwieldy materials // chainsaws and ladders // We are going to bring _. // hoops and mallets }} needed to play it into {{ small containers // matchboxes //  // travel tubes }} for safe travel.

Upon arrival in nearby Bentonville, Arkansas, the Game Smugglers rendez-voused with {{ a radio personality // Marty Moss-Coane, host of Radio Times in Philadelphia //  // Ira Glass }} and a famous appraiser of {{ collectible items // rare coins //  // crossword puzzles }} from the area at {{ an odd name for a restaurant // Eats Me //  // Mom’s Lap }}, the finest restaurant in the state, like city folk do.

There had been some worry about cabin size, but all were happy to find that the cabins had enough beds for {{ a large group of people // everyone who's ever been on Law and Order //  // a Mongolian horde }}.

There was no worry about starvation, because the Game Smugglers had accidentally purchased enough food to feed {{ a group of hungry animals // a pride of ravenous lions //  // the original hippos from Hungry Hungry Hippos }}. Items purchased included {{ an exotic food item // frog legs //  // dragon fruit }}, copious amounts of rose water, and {{ a delicacy // blackened Chilean sea bass //  // crow eggs }}. An iconic photo was taken of the Hostess gesturing at the bounty.

## Shining summer days

The children behaved, and all went generally according to plan. The Appraiser and a fellow sungazer related how the recent solar eclipse had changed their lives.

Practical questions arose about where to discard compost, but the Hostess told guests to simply {{ do something you shouldn’t do with compost  // flush it down the toilet // Please do not _. // hide it }}. A young family bought a pig and returned it.

A child didn’t want to go down the stairs to the lake, the downstairs lake, so Friendly shared that his favorite way to go down the stairs was “{{ your favorite way to go down the stairs // by sliding down the handrail // I will go down these stairs _. // by twirling as I descend }}”.

Similarly, the Hostess tried and failed to get your chronicler to play bocce by claiming, “{{ something positive about bocce // bocce is good for the soul // You should play bocce because _. // it’s the game of the future }}”.

Instead, the game of the day was the Peace Stand, whereby two contenders brace themselves against one another while standing in the water on a raft or other wobbly vessel, and profess their commitment to peace by saying something like “{{ a prayer for peace // I pray for peace, I pray for peace, I pray one day all wars may cease //  // god of the Lake, bring peace to these shores and this wobbly vessel }}”, until one of them falls off, and loses.

## Playful nights, and lasting memories

Dinner was a memorable peanut stew, or maybe cashew, as the cabin held every imaginable expiring spice.

The Sungazer led a tour of celestial bodies by canoe, noting that his favorite was “{{ a celestial body, and why you like it // Orion, because it’s easy to spot // // the moon, because it governs my mood }}”. The tourists kept seeing fireflies, but they were really fast, but also really low, and they were like, “{{ a perplexed statement // What the eff is going on here? //  // Excuse me? }}”

Brian, the Hostess, and the Future Mother lingered on the porch to discuss family matters.

On the last day, the friends said their goodbyes. The Reverse Pig Thieves departed with a minority of the excess groceries. The Hostess made coffee so strong that it {{ did something only very strong coffee can do // kept me up all year // That coffee was so strong that it _. // got me to finish my novel }}.

Reflecting back over the years, all involved remembered fondly the friends, the leisure, {{ a positive memory you have, or that you can imagine, from a day at the lake // swimming to a weird little island and back //  // gazing into the unknown }}, the warm lake, and beautiful sky.
