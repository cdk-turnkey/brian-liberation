# A Very Socially Isolated Passover

Friends, family, {{ a group of people other than friends and family // un-related non-friends // Those people are _. // strangers }}, others, we are gathered here tonight to celebrate {{ an event that has definitely not happened // the cloning of a dinosaur // _ has never happened. // talking plants }}.

Normally, Passover is a time of {{ something positive // gaiety // I am enjoying all of this (or these) ___. // well-mannered frivolity }} and {{ edible things // pasta // You can eat _. // the contents of seder plates }}.

In today’s age of {{ something bizarre // purple warts // __ is/are crazy! // baby-eating dingos }} , it is important to remember that we {{ intransitive verb // stand // we __  over here // meditate }} together as one {{ noun // liver // That is a(n) ___ // elephant trunk }}.

To that end, we are gathered together by video conference.

# # {{ Page }}

## Agenda | seder

Anyway, let’s go over this {{ item // flatiron // the __ // bushel }}. Under ordinary circumstances, such as {{ an ordinary circumstance // a trip to the laundromat // The event was  ___.  // a garden-variety Passover }}, we would literally conduct all Passover activities together. In many cases, we will still be able to do these actions by ourselves, provided we have the required materials in our {{ places where people live // castles // Those people live in their ___. // provinces }}. For example, if you brought wine to our remote seder, you can drink it at the kadeish. If you have {{ an object // a hammer // I have  __. // a squid }}, you can {{ transitive verb (an action that is done to a thing) // thump // I will ___ it. // hump }} it at the koreich. If you don’t have these items, it doesn’t matter, because it’s all symbolic anyway!

However, if you want to physically participate, here are some suggestions. If you don’t have wine, you can bless {{ something you would never bless // Satan // I would never bless ___. // Haman }}. If you lack greens to dip, just {{ transitive verb // elevate // you can __ this // marinate }} some {{ nouns // donkeys // multiple __ // croutons your sister sat on }}. If you are missing matza, marror, charoset, or your entire meal, are you just {{ an object that is used for something // a slinky // That is  ___ // a pillow }}?

Now that all loose ends are tied, we can finally SING!

# Kiddush will be kiddush | kadeish

The blessing over the wine is 100% necessary. You don’t want to miss the blessing over the wine. It’s so important that if you forget to bless the wine, you will end up {{ a terrible thing to happen to you // eaten by alligators // I was ______ and that was the saddest day of my life // alone forever. }} But if you don’t have wine, no problem, just bless whatever is in your {{ a container // pool // this is a ____ // fishtank }}. It’s ok, I swear. Let’s do it together:

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree hagafen.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם,

    שֶׁהֶחֱיָנוּ וְקִיְּמָנוּ וְהִגִּיעָנוּ לַזְּמַן הַזֶּה:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam,

    she-hechiyanu v’key’manu v’higiyanu lazman hazeh.

Now that you’ve blessed the sacrificial wine, let’s bring it home by saying the incredibly important ending phrase: {{ a fun phrase // Got Milk // I love the saying "_____"  // What goes up must come down}}

Let us all now drink the wine, like {{ someone who drinks wine // // // Tyrion Lannister }}.

# # {{ Page }}

# Shake ya glass, but wash yaself! | urchatz

By now, your hands are likely covered in {{ something gross // vomit // ew, it’s covered in ___ // fish eggs }}. If you don’t wash thoroughly before the end of this section, you will definitely get {{ a strange disease // leprosy // a case of ___ // boils }}. To be really safe, we should all wash our {{ body parts // feet // we have ___ // gums }}, scrub our {{ body parts // hips // we have ___ // neurons}} and sterilize our {{ body parts // intestines // we have ___ // spleens}}.

Here is how we shall proceed.

1. I will exclaim something, while pantomiming it.

2. You will listen to it.

3. {{ Someone in the video call tonight // // __ is here tonight // I }} will {{ take an inappropriate action // burp // He will __ // kvetch }}.

4. You will repeat the sacred phrase and the pantomime.

And now, without further ado, the sacred, cleansing phrase commanded by God is….

{{ transitive verb command // drive // ___ them! // lift }} those {{ things // marbles // you have ___ // manuscripts }}; {{ something you are told to do // do the dishes //  You have to __! // wash between your toes }}!”

Now we’re all clean! We can start to begin thinking about maybe pondering having dinner.

# # {{ Page }}

# Gratitude Interlude

Let’s take a pause from this busy schedule to reflect on what is meaningful in our lives. In three words or less say what you are grateful for. I’ll go first. Then we’ll go in an order determined by me.

[[ Go around the virtual room as stated, saying something about what is meaningful in your life, if you are moved to do so. ]]

And that was it. Time to move on.

# When I dip, you dip, we dip a green vegetable in saltwater | karpas

And we begin with the Hebrew again:

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree ha-adama.

    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who creates the fruits of the earth.

Lets dip this wonderful green {{ something green // Granny Smith Apple // I love how green this ___ is // Granny Smith Apple }}. I bet you're wondering WHY we dip this delightful green...thing into salt water. There is a song that explains it. Listen…

[[ Sing to the tune of “Mary had a little lamb” ]]

    {{ Name that rhymes with “Mary” // Carrie // their name is ___  // Larry }} has a little herb

    Little herb

    Little herb!

    {{ Name that rhymes with “Mary” // Gary // their name is ___  // Fairy}} has a little herb

    It tastes of {{ one-syllable word that rhymes with "piece" // geese // __ rhymes with "piece" // grease }} and {{ one-syllable thing with a long "o" sound in it // prose // // foam }}!

And that is why we dip our green vegetables in saltwater - to remind us how agonizing it is to eat them.

# # {{ Page }}

# It's time for a matzah break! | yachatz

We are not eating, yet. We DO get to {{ transitive verb you do with your hands // touch // use your hands to ___ something // juggle }} our food though!

We break our matzah to honor the broken-heartedness we hide during most of the year. According to another interpretation by the great Rabbi {{ Jewish-sounding name // Shmuel Baruchstein //  ____ // Shapiroberg }}, we break matzah in order to break from our habit of {{ doing something we find embarrassing // walking with our fly down //   ___ is so embarrassing for us! // picking our noses in public }}.

Whatever meaning you attribute to this act, it is {{ a celebrity // Kim Kardashian // ___ is famous // Madonna }} ‘s will that it be done.

After we break, the larger half will be hidden so well that not even {{ a distinguished person or group // The Beatles // I am here to see ____ // the Secretary of Housing and Human Development }}{{ a celebrity // Kim Kardashian // ___ is famous // Madonna }} can find it. We hide the larger half because more is hidden from us than is revealed.

The hidden part will become the Afikomen and we will deal with it later.

At last, our moment has come. There is no blessing, there is no curse. Just snap your unleavened bread...Go!

# Pre-Pre-magid - What is this all about?

Have you ever wondered why you are not a slave today? Have you ever wondered why, instead of {{ verb ending in -ing // punishing   // you are __ it // licking }} your master’s {{ things someone purchases // bagels  // I bought some __  // horseshoes}} every day, you get to {{ a thing you do in your spare time // chop wood without a shirt // i am happy to ___ // pressure cook beans }} and {{ a thing you would like to do // listen to music // i am happy to ___ // stretch my toes }} whenever you please?

The reason for your freedom lies in this holy tale. It is a hymn of {{ characteristic or emotion // courage  // a person of great __  // dignity}} and extreme {{ characteristic or emotion // courage  // a person of great __   // nudity }}, of how the hero of the Hebrews risked everything to free his people, with nothing but his mighty {{ something long // obelisk // that is a long ___ // broomstick }} and a little help from an omnipotent friend. And we will tell this story {{ a moment in time // now // we will celebrate this ___ // next year }}.

Before we do anything that gets us closer to eating, we must think about why we are here...

# # {{ Page }}

# Pre-magid - The REAL Questions (read by the youngest present)

[[ Stage direction: Identify the youngest individual present, and cede control of the seder them. They read the following: ]]

We Jews are a questioning people, and I’m a tiny baby. Why are we doing this? Where did it all start? {{ a question a child would ask // where do babies come from? // ___? // when is dinner? }}? {{ a ridiculous question // why is your mouth full of coal? // ___? // who dealt it? }}?

Fortunately, someone has already thrown us a shank bone and given us the right questions to ask tonight. We can sing them together in perfect Hebrew.

Why do we dip not once, but {{ a number greater than 1 // 99.8 // __ is great than 1 // 1.5 }} times?

Why do we recline, and not {{ verb phrase // swim the English Channel // he likes to __ // staple papers }} all night long?

# Pre-Post-Pre-magid - Answering the Questions

Here is the long and short of it: We were slaves in {{ a place // a park // here is ___ // a vestibule }} in ancient {{ a municipality or country // Beijing // i live in ___ // Philadelphia }} or something like that.

We got free and now we are grateful. What we will never be free of, however, is having to tell this story.

# {{ Page }}

# Post-Pre-Magid: Think of the Children!

Children are our future leaders and there are exactly four (4) archetypes, so we can easily predict what they will say in any given situation. Of course, we want to encourage our children to define their own identities, so today we introduce…

1. {{ a high-born sounding name // Eggleton // __ is my name // Cordelia }} the {{ adjective  // praiseworthy // it is ___ // polymorphic }} {{ professional title // doctor // i got hired as a(n) ___ // executive director }}. They represent all that is wise.

2. {{ an unpleasant-sounding name // Wormtail // __ is my name // Barfneck }} the {{ negative adjective // disgusting // unfortunately, it is ___ // horrible }} {{ a singular thing // bag // it is a(n) ___ // ulcer }}. They manifest all that is wicked.

3. {{ a monosyllabic name // Biff // __ is my name // Kirk }} the {{ past participle // regurgitated // he has ___ it // eaten }} {{ container of something and the thing it contains // box of marbles // it is a(n) ___ // bag of doritos }}. They are but a simple presence here.

4. {{ thing // raisin // this is a ___ // Shovel }} the {{ adjective // heavy // it is ___ // corny }} {{ animal // ostrich // look at the ___ // whale }}. They don’t know why they are here.

Let’s apply their predictable thinking to the logic of Passover.

## # {{ Page }}

## The Wise Child’s Question

Hello, I am the wise child, check out my bona fides:

Last year, I {{ took an intelligent action // cracked the code //  // hacked the mainframe }}. Last month, I {{ did something noble // liberated the nation //  // found the hypotenuse }}. And just yesterday, when {{ there was a problem // the sky was falling // We were afraid because ___. // the invaders invaded }}, I saved the WORLD by {{ solving a problem // healing the sick // I was ___. // finding the missing }}.

I doubt any of you understand the significance of my actions, or how they have contributed to the growing body of {{ elite subject matter // pre-natal brain development // i wrote a paper on ___ // post-revolution cannibalism }} theory. Therefore, I will ask YOU a question to jolt your brain.

What are the statutes, testimonies, laws, and {{ exercises // push-ups // I was doing ___. // social dances }} that God has commanded us to do?

I’m only asking because I want to expand the seder franchise.

# {{ Page }}

## The Wise Answer

Wise child, sit down. I got this. On the most BASIC level, God commands us to {{ take an action // lift the puppy // I am going to __ // create a docket }} before we {{ take an action // make a cake // I am going to __ // screw the pooch }}. This means that one may not EVER {{ take an action // sing // I am going to ___. // leave the chamber }} after {{ an event // the shrew parade // I attended ___. // the taming of the shrew }}. I know that sounds complicated, but fortunately there are three categories of sub-laws to clarify God’s position. They are:

### Chukim

These are the most unreasonable and nonsensical laws that you would never generate on your own, like “don’t mix wool with linen” and, “ {{ A weird piece of advice // Don’t put BBQ sauce in your pants //  // Always sit on the butter before you eat it }},” and of course, {{ An inexplicably strange law // Don’t use paper in February // // Don’t churn butter in the bathroom  }}.

### Edot

These are the reasonable-but-not-necessarily intuitive laws, like {{ an obscure, but reasonable biblical law // thou shalt milk the cow three times // ___ // honor thy neighbor's garbage }}. These also encompass laws commanding you to celebrate Shabbat, Festivals, and Important Rites of Passage, such as {{ a rite of passage // learning to ride a bike //  // the first time eating solid food }}.

### Mishpatim

These are the Intuitive Laws, like don’t get caught stealing, or {{ something you’d probably get in trouble for if you were caught by your parents // watching too much TV // I got grounded for__ // punching your brother in his private parts}}.

Do you get it now?? The laws of Pesach should make total sense to you at this point...

## # {{ Page }}

## The Wicked Child’s Question

{{ An annoying thing to say to get attention // Yo, losers! // ___ // Pickle my feet, Piglets! }}!

I don’t care about you or any of my so-called people! All I wanna do is {{ take an action // sell stocks // I am going to ___ // hunt pandas }}, and eat {{ something edible // buttercream // he will eat___ // nutter butters }} in my {{ something you own // hat // check out my __ // socks }}.

Hey, {{ someone in this videoconference //  //  // Vinny }}, you look like you just crawled out of {{ a place // The National Constitution Center // __ is a place // Marsden's toilet }} and {{ someone in this videoconference //  //  // Andi }} you look like you just got done {{ verb ending in -ing // swimming // look at it, ___ over there // prancing }} on {{ a place something could rest on // the dining room table // he put it on ___ // Lincoln's upper lip }}.

So why should a {{ a living or non-living thing // peach tree // it is a(n) __ // weasel }} like me care about Passover?

And what’s up with these so called “commands?” And who is making us do all this - , {{ someone who gives or has given commands // the chief of police //  // Genghis Khan }}? Like, why do i have to {{ A complaint in present tense // go to school today // I am annoyed because I have to ____ // take my grandmother to church}} tonight?

What does all this mean to YOU?!

## # {{ Page }}

## The Wicked Answer

Wicked child, you are not part of the tribe. We would all make {{ something not solid // gelatin // ___ is not solid // soup }} of your {{ body parts // organs // he has __ // bones }} if we could. We already regret inviting you, for you are the worst of all children. You are worse than {{ a villain // Pol Pot // ___ is a horrible character // Haman }}, but still, we are blessed you are here.

It is important to question the meaning of things like why {{ a phenomenon that occurs // the sun rises  // i have always wondered why __ // my belt buckle breaks after eating }} or why {{ plural noun // donkeys // those are ___ // elves }} {{ transitive verb // encourage // they __ it // tickle }} {{ plural noun // green cans // those are ___ // fish }}.

BUT it is more important that you blindly follow nonsensical biblical commands lest you be killed by a vengeful deity.

So do whatever God says.

Let’s move on to your Simpler Sibling.

## # {{ Page }}

## The Simple Child’s Question

So, like, I have a pretty straightforward question.

{{ An extremely basic, fundamental question // // // What is this? }}

I’m sorry, let me slightly rephrase that: {{ An extremely basic, fundamental question // // // What is this? }} You know what I mean?

## # {{ Page }}

## The Simple Answer

Um, are you even talking about Passover? One of these is the answer you seek:

1. It was always {{ something doing something // a frog eating a fly // yesterday, I saw  __ // my uncle Joe reading the newspaper }}

2. {{ adjective + noun // green clay // look at that ___ // simple syrup }}

3. Passover

Pick one, and then let’s hear from your sibling, the child who learned how to {{ action requiring a high degree of skill // cut diamonds // she mastered how to __ // write a novel }} before they learned how to ask questions.

## # {{ Page }}

## The Child-Who-Knows-Not-How-to-Ask-a-Question’s Question

Ha ray bahray tel ab et terrah. Nori weldicans, sming diggle {{ gibberish phrase // geng di boot wumph //  // gleg shifty tarley memdi katch ingoo}}. Schlups? SCHLUPS??? Crem benna ding, renna ren {{ US City // Las Vegas // the great city of __ // Indianapolis}}?.

Zing wish flooby? Helta cling {{ character in book or movie // Peter Pan // // Cinderella}} fish pho?!

## # {{ Page }}

## Meta-Dayeinu

Why, that’s the best question we’ve heard all night, and there have been a LOT of questions!

If we had heard from just the first of these obnoxious children, that would have been enough.

If we had stopped after the second child, that would definitely have been enough!

If we were to stop reading this Haggadah right now, eat our meal, and then say to one another: “{{ something you say at the end of a conference call //  //  // let's circle back; I have a hard stop }}”, and the go off and {{ do something you do at home // nap // // binge Netflix }}, that would be enough for us. In fact, anything more might be too much.

However, for our ancestors long, long ago in the land of Egypt, it was never enough. So let’s do them this honor, lift our glasses, which by now should be full of {{ a liquid // gasoline // ___ is a liquid // plasma }}, and sing a little song about how we used to be slaves.

בָדִים הָיִינוּ הָיִינוּ. עַתָּה בְּנֵי חוֹרִין:

    Avadim hayinu. Ata b’nei chorin.

# # {{ Page }}

# The Mad Liberation | magid

Blessedly, we have reached the part of the seder that always stays the same, like {{ something that always stays the same //  //  // Pope Constantine }}. It is a tale as old as time itself, and as {{ adjective attributed to something rotten // moldy //  // smelly }} as {{ something smelly // fish  // __ is/are smelly  // frogs }}. Indeed, the story of Moses and his good deeds is the same whether told in person, {{ in a place // at the drive-in // I am __. // in Florence }}, or on a video call.

Long ago, being a Jew was not easy. Indeed, we were slaves, all because the wicked Pharaoh feared our great numbers, especially our {{ a great number // seventy //  // three }} and our {{ a number // eleven million //  // zero }}. Forced to {{ perform a professional service // prepare tax returns // it’s an honor to__  // do the landscaping for the Met }}, we lived in misery. Even worse, we had to design, build, and maintain {{ something found in Egypt // the pyramids //  // sacred cats }}.

But one day, a young boy was born who would solve everything.

## # {{ Page }}

## Guns n Moses

The Hebrew boy Moses was born on death row, and the first thing he did was get pretend-executed.

He floated down the long {{ something long and flat // shuffleboard table  //  // abyss }} in a boat made of {{ items // toothbrushes //  // ironing boards }}, and beached on the beach, where he was found by Pharaoh’s {{ type of person // personal trainer // This is my ___. // math inventor }}.

“He looks like a young {{ name of a celebrity // Harrison Ford // Watch out, that's ___. // Timothée Chalamet }},” she cried. “I will raise him as my own. I just hope he grows up to be {{ a practitioner of an occupation // a dentist //  // a product support specialist }}.”

Moses did indeed grow up to be a strong, healthy, {{ practitioner of an occupation // shirtmaker //  // robot hunter }}. He was so good that one day an Egyptian saw him and just died.

Moses took full responsibility. He announced, “{{ A speech you would give to accept full responsibility // I want to address concerns over my recent actions. First and foremost, I accept full responsibility. I regret what I have done, and I wholeheartedly apologize to anyone who might have been hurt. //  // Mistakes were made. }}”. The Egyptians forgave him by chasing him out of Egypt to Midian on pain of death.

## # {{ Page }}

## Easter’s coming, so save our peeps!

Midian was {{ adjective // bad //  // lit }}. Moses got to {{ verb // eat //  // spin }} all day with his personal {{ occupation // architect //  // gardener }}, like one does. He even found somebody to multiply with. We’re all related to them.

Anyway, Moses went out for a {{ noun // // a __ is a person, place, or thing // thing }} and saw a burning {{ flammable object // block of whale fat // a(n) ___  // matchstick }}. He killed the Egyptian who he thought started the fire, and the burning thing spoke, introducing itself as God.

“Thou shalt not kill,” it said.

“Too soon,” said Moses. “And too late…”

“Fine,” said God, “then get ye unto Egypt and plague Pharaoh into freeing the Jews.”

And Moses took his {{ piece of equipment // canteen //  // vorpal sword }} in hand, his rod/staff in his other hand, his {{ piece of equipment // carabiner //  // pickaxe }} balanced on his head, and rode his {{ animal // dragon //  // ass }} back to Egypt illegally, where he freed the Jews and led us to the Israel area, where we all lived happily ever after. After the next twenty pages of events.

## # {{ Page }}

## God’s plague-ground

Moses moseyed into the capital, {{ an ancient Egyptian city (real or fake, up to you) // Bubastis //  // Memphis }}, to try to pull Pharaoh to the left on slave policies.

Unfortunately, the ultimatum only moved Pharaoh to yell out his catch phrase, “{{ Pharaoh's catch phrase //  //  // Oh, no! That's not fair, oh! }},” and to double everyone’s burdens.

Moses responded with his catch phrase, “{{ Moses's catch phrase //  //  // I'm here to laugh out with my staff out }},” and made a snake of his stick, and went to go get plagues.

### # {{ Page }}

### Blood | dam

Moses introduced the coming plagues by saying, “{{ A polite way of telling people you're about to turn the river into blood // Sir, I apologize, but I am about to turn your river gently into blood //  // Drink blood, my good sir }}”.

The people got really tired of {{ doing something you normally do with water // bathing //  // taking their probiotics }} with blood, and of cooking their {{ something you cook in water // couscous //  // kidney beans }} with it.

Pharaoh, though, still had water, as everyone’s blood had been turned into water. Moreover, Pharaoh explained that changing the river into blood was a well-known Egyptian parlour trick, like {{ a parlour trick // //  // turning your tongue upside-down }}.

To prove his point, all Pharaoh’s assistants then also transformed the river into blood, which was kind of easy given that the river was already blood, and Pharaoh hunkered down for the next plague.

### # {{ Page }}

### Frogs | tzfardeiya

They were led by {{ a famous frog //  //  // Robin }}, the famous frog.

### # {{ Page }}

### Lice | kinim

[[ Stage direction: Let the previous reader read this one, as that last one was offensively short. ]]

“Ok…” said Pharaoh, “So I’m not freeing anyone just because frogs. I actually dig frogs, especially for {{ doing with frogs something that you could do with frogs // making frog legs //  // de-legging }}.”

“But {{ something Moses would say to get Pharaoh's attention // Hey, Pharaoh! //  // yo-yo Pharaoh }},“ cried Noah, I mean Moses, “These frogs have lice!”

And the lice said, “{{ Something lice would say // We're lice, and we're not nice. Free our people, don't think twice! // Lice be like, ___. // Nothing is worse than us! Definitely not seven things. }}.”

Ok, next plague.

### # {{ Page }}

### Wild Animals | arov

Unfortunately for the plaguer-hating Pharaoh, the lice had wild animals on them. One of the lice, {{ a name a louse (singular of lice) would have //  //  // Bryce }}, was infested with {{ wild animals // bison //  // wombats }}. The {{ wild animals // bears //  // capybaras }}, {{ wild animals // lions //  // cobras }}, and especially the {{ wild animals // tigers //  // civets }} rampaged through the {{ public space // park //  // thoroughfare }}, invaded the {{ local business // cake shop //  // bar }}, and didn’t buy anything. The lice left.

Unfortunately for God, Pharaoh simply enslaved the animals. Unfortunately for the animals, Pharaoh doubled their burdens. It hurt all the more because they had known what it was to live free.

### # {{ Page }}

### Cattle Disease | dever

God’s next punishment was indirect. “Listen,” He said: “{{ something God would say to inspire fear // Be afraid, for I am God! //  // Boo! }}”.

This infected one cow with a terrible cow disease. Symptoms included fatigue, listlessness, lack of direction, and {{ a symptom of a cow disease // cramps //  // cow-coughing }}. To prove that this was not impressive, Pharaoh ordered his magicians to infect the rest of the cattle of Egypt with the same disease.

“Oh, please, Pharaoh!” said the cattle, “give the Jews what they want, so we can go back to {{ doing something cows do // mooing // I see the cows, and they are __. // cowtowing }}, and being eaten.”

“I don’t care what the cows think, cows don’t vote,” said Pharaoh. “And neither do my people. Plague it again, Sam.”

Distraught, the cattle turned to God. “Oh, God,” they said, “{{ something a cow would say to God //  //  // Moo }}. And while you’re at it, please cure us of this terrible cattle disease!”

### # {{ Page }}

### Boils | scheen

To exert further pressure on Pharaoh, God, via Moses, caused the cattle to erupt into boils. And not in a good way. The heartless Pharaoh put the boils to work, forcing them to build tiny boil-sized monuments out of {{ tiny improvised building materials //  //  // bumpkins and biddlesticks }}.

Distraught, the boils turned to God, and said, “{{ something a boil would say //  //  // Try not to touch me }}. And please, oh, please, rain down hail on the people and especially the cattle of Egypt, that we boils might pop, and fill the river with pus instead of blood, so that the Jews may go free to worship You in the wilderness!”

### # {{ Page }}

### Hail | barad

And so God rained giant {{ large object // elephant // // rocket }}-sized hail balls down from the sky. This somehow only affected the Egyptians, due to God’s excellent aim and because the Jews had giant {{ large object // elephant // // rocket}}-sized, {{ large object // elephant // // rocket}}-shaped umbrellas.

### # {{ Page }}

### Locusts | arbeh

“I can deal with blood, lice, hail, cattle disease, {{ pandemic // coronavirus //  // coronavirus }}, lice, boils and wild animals” said Pharoah, “It still doesn’t compete with having Jews as slaves. Jewish slaves are like negative fifteen plagues.”

“Seriously?” said Moses. “Well, then how about locusts?”

“They’re fine, too,” said Pharaoh.

“Dam,” said Moses.

“That was blood!” said Pharoah.

“Good hebrew!” said God, adding under His breath, “for a Pharaoh...”

### Darkness | choshech

It’s too dark. I can’t read this plague.

### # {{ Page }}

### Slaying of the First Born | makat Bechorot

And so God decided to do something pretty drastic and off-brand.

“Don’t worry, Moses, they wanna {{ verb //  // They will ___ with us. // dance }} with the G-O-D? They’re gonna get served. I’ve written this rap to emphasize the next step.”

    So you think this GOD doesn’t have what it takes

    To convince you to let go of your chicka-chicka slaves.

    Well take notes, Pharoah, you’re about to learn,

    When I go and kill all of your {{ Person, place, or thing that rhymes with “first born” //  // // worst porn}}.

Pharaoh said, “Did you mean, ‘first born’?”

“Yes,” said God.

Pharaoh shrugged and said, “Bring it, I was cloned.”

So the Jews huddled in their homes, only allowed to talk via Zoom, watch Netflix, and {{ do something you do when you're quarantined // bake bread // During this quarantine, I am going to ___. // get into figure drawing }}. God killed everyone who stood less than 6 feet apart from anyone else. Pharaoh's eldest son, who had been misled by Fox news into taking {{ a bogus remedy // snake oil //  // hydroxychloroquine }} and using tactical butt wipes, died long before any of this even happened.

“Stop this nonsense! The {{ members of an ethnic group, other than Jews // Italians //  // Irish}} can go free!” said Pharaoh.

Moses: “You mean the Jews?”

Pharaoh: “Ohhh, you were asking about ‘the Jews?’ This whole time? Sure, they can go free. I forgot I even had them. I thought you were asking me to free my personal {{ lowly service provider // ditch digger //  // nail trimmer }}, Thachooze. Thachooze, get back to work! I hereby double your burdens.”

### Freedom!!!

So the Jews were freed. They told God they were going into the wilderness to worship Him, then headed to the {{ body of water // Atlantic ocean // we’re going to __  //  Bahamas }} to party and hook up.

Later on, Pharoah got to thinking, “If i don’t have slaves, i’m gonna have to mummify...MYSELF. I don’t even have a son anymore to do it for me.”

So Pharoah changes his mind, jumps into his {{ vehicle // car //  // rocket }} and chases after the Jews. Moses, who kinda saw this coming, gets out his big {{ phallic object // carrot //  // eggplant }} waves it in the air, and the sea totally splits in two. They cross the ocean and when the Egyptians get to the center of the ocean, God says, “{{ a mean exclamation // Screw you! //  // Shame! }}” and murders them.

The Jews celebrate, God gets mad, and makes them wander for 40 years, but then everything’s fine.

And they lived happily ever after.

# Dayeinu

In freeing the Jews, God did so much more than the bare minimum required.

If God had merely {{verbed (past tense) a noun // funneled a beer // he once ___ // sat on a toilet}}, that would have been ok.

Now if God had {{verbed (past tense) a noun // baked a cake // he once ___ // picked his nose}}, that would have been fine.

If God had {{verbed (past tense) a noun // bit his tongue // he once ___ // farmed some vegetables}}, that would’ve worked well, too.

This is summed up best in a 5-minute song.

[[ STAGE DIRECTION: All sing Dayeinu. ]]

אִלּוּ הוֹצִיאָֽנוּ מִמִּצְרַֽיִם, דַּיֵּנוּ:

    Ilu hotzianu mi-mitzrayim, Dayeinu

    If God had only taken us out of Egypt, that would have been enough!

אִלּוּ נָתַן לָֽנוּ אֶת־הַתּוֹרָה, דַּיֵּנוּ:

    Ilu natan lanu et ha-Torah, Dayeinu

    If God had only given us the Torah, that would have been enough.

אִלּוּ הוֹצִיאָֽנוּ מִמִּצְרַֽיִם, דַּיֵּנוּ:

    Ilu hotzianu mi-mitzrayim, Dayeinu

    If God had only taken us out of Egypt, that would have been enough!

אִלּוּ נָתַן לָֽנוּ אֶת־הַתּוֹרָה, דַּיֵּנוּ:

    Ilu natan lanu et ha-Torah, Dayeinu

    If God had only given us the Torah, that would have been enough.

# The Passover symbols

[[ STAGE DIRECTION: Hold up a proverbial shank bone, or pretend to ]]

This, my Jews, is a {{handheld item // coffee cup // I am holding a ___// digital watch}}. It represents a dead lamb. I bring it everywhere with me.

[[ STAGE DIRECTION: Hold up some proverbial matzah, or pretend to ]]

This is a {{flat thing// plate // The earth is as flat as a___// rug }}. It’s probably the most famous passover symbol. Even my goy friend, {{a flamboyant name // Tessa the best dressa // // Rupaul}} knows what this is! It represents settling for the next best thing.

[[ STAGE DIRECTION: Hold up some proverbial maror (horseradish), or pretend to ]]

Lastly, but not the last thing before we eat, this {{a barely edible item// this __ // // tuna fish}}, is a bitter herb. It symbolizes the bitterness of slavery and of having to wait 25 hours to eat dinner.

# Wine Shots, Part Deux

This is our {{very old birthday number // // On my __ birthday // 140th }} glass of wine. Sing.

בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree hagafen.

    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who creates the fruit of the vine.

# Wash your hands and get back to work | rachtza

They say you shouldn’t {{ do an unclean act // make a mud castle // I am going to ___. // squirt squid ink }} where you {{ do an action that requires cleanliness // eat // It had better be clean when I ___. // perform surgery }}. Well, I just did. I did it so hard, YOUR hands are dirty. So let’s wash our hands. I have to wash my {{ body part // foot // This is my ___. // sternum }}, too, because that’s what I did it with.

As we pretend to wash our hands, say this with me. Do NOT sing this.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָֽׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתָיו, וְצִוָּנוּ

עַל נְטִילַת יָדָֽיִם:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu

al n’tilat yadayim.

# Well, bless my little bread | motzi matzah

At this point in the seder, it is customary for {{ Name of person in the video conference // // __ is with us tonight// Josh }} to {{ engage in an activity // square dance  // he always loves to _____ // yodel }}

So, to keep with tradition, please do this so that we may move forward.

[[ STAGE DIRECTION: Dramatically Pause ]]

Ok now, everyone hold up some matzoh while we all sing to bless this breadless bread.

     בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, הַמּוֹצִיא לֶֽחֶם מִן הָאָֽרֶץ:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, hamotzi lechem min ha-aretz.

    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who brings bread from the land.

בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָֽׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתַָיו וְצִוָּֽנוּ עַל אֲכִילַת מַצָּה:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu

al achilat matzah.

    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who made us holy through obligations, commanding us to eat matzah.

# # {{ Page }}

# Justa little bittah more | maror

We now sing as we spread delicious charoset and religiously-significant (kinda gross) maror on so-gross-it-has-to-be-religiously-significant matzoh. This represents the bittersweetness of doing rituals when you’re hungry. Just dip--do not eat.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיַָ אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָֽׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתָיו וְצִוָּֽנוּ עַל אֲכִילַת מָרוֹר:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, asher kid’shanu b’mitzvotav v’tzivanu

al achilat maror.

    We praise God, Ruler of Everything, who made us holy through obligations, commanding us to eat bitter herbs.

## Eat, but not the meal | koreich

We now eat this {{ collection of foods that doesn’t go together well // cream cheese popsicle // after trying a ____ he decided he wouldn’t eat that ever again // cream cheese tuna popsicle }} as our ancestors did before us. It symbolizes misery, we think.

## # {{ Page }}

## Revise the Haggadah endlessly

As is tradition, we will now workshop the entire Haggadah up to this point, and refine it into a product we can charge money for, in observation of the unpleasant tasks performed by our ancestors, the Jews.

JUST KIDDING.

## The THIRD glass of wine (starting to feel it yet?)

Please have your third glass of wine (we hope you didn’t have any more wine during dinner), and sing another song.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן:

# Elijah’s cup. Ghosts like getting drunk, too!

Elijah can not only open doors, but he can get into a zoom meeting without the password. He’s here right now. Pour him a drink and tell him how your really feel. Repeat after me.

Thank you Elijah for being such a(n) {{ adjective // funny // // awful }} spirit.

Everyone!

Thank you Elijah for being such a(n) (adjective from above) spirit.

Now let's sing!

    Im mashiach ben-David

    Elijah the prophet, the returning,

    the man of Gilad:

    return to us speedily, in our days with the messiah, son of David.

# Closing rites

## The FOURTH glass of wine

As we drink this last cup of wine, we contemplate what we want for this year. I, for one, want {{ a thing I want // money // he wants ____ // tacos }}. As we sing, we praise God, we appreciate one another, and we cherish the time we have together and the memories we create. And this lengthy Haggadah we write every year.

    בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יְיָ, אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הַגָּפֶן:

    Baruch Atah Adonai, Eloheinu Melech ha-olam, borei p’ree hagafen.



    לְשָׁנָה הַבָּאָה בִּירוּשָׁלָֽיִם:

    L’shana haba-ah biy’rushalayim!

    Next year in person!
