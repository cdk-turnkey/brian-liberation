# A Brief History of Brian Liberation

Four thousand years ago, the Hebrews were freed from {{ a place you wouldn't want to be // Staten Island // I want to escape from _. // eternal dishwashing }} by {{ a kind person from history // George Washington Carver //  // Marie Curie }}.

Doug wanted to celebrate this occasion by creating a custom {{ mechanical device // typewriter //  // garment steamer }}, but he didn’t know how. Brian arrived, and showed him how to {{ do a complex task // transcribe the ancient sea scrolls // I am going to _. // blanch a tomato just right }}, and Doug was able to fill in the blanks from there.

So meta. Years later, Doug and Brian were in the same {{ type of group of people // craft circle // Those two people are members of a _. // municipal union }}, and Doug drew Brian’s name out of a {{ container // box //  // shipping container }}, resulting in Brian Liberation.
