# A Very Practice Passover
#### A safe space to learn how to play Mad Liberation
Come, Jew, on a Jewney of liberation.


## The bad old days
Have you ever been to a seder where someone says, “Stop looking at your phone”?


The only thing that ruins Passover quicker than that is when someone {{ does something disruptive //  // She _ // leaves with the seder plate }}.


Here comes another ad-libbed, user-supplied word or phrase, coming at you like {{ something fast and heavy // // This is _ // a damn lib }}.


Anway, the point of this thing is to make it so people can look at their phones while celebrating Passover.

Well, this is fun. It’s important for a Haggadah to span multiple pages, like a textual {{ long thing // // This is a _ // snake }}.


Some pages will have songs. Some songs will have libs, as in:
    If you like
    {{ three-syllable person/place/thing that rhymes with “ay” // my bidet // That is __. // Claude Monet }}
    You can {{ verb // // I like to _ // read him }} every day,
    Seders are fine
    Good Haggadahs have to rhyme


Others will not.

## More information
Now that you get the hang of it, how about some actual information? We don’t want this Practice Script to be {{ something non-informative // // This is __. // a blank space }}.


[[ This is a stage direction, a Mad Liberation experimental feature. Don’t read this aloud. ]]


Mad Liberation was conceived as a way of having fun. Before computers, its inventors used to print out printed scripts on {{ archaic machines //  // Let’s use __. // steam engines }}, and pass around a deck of {{ things you could technically write on // bananas // We will write on __. // dry erase boards  }}. On these items, participants would answer questions with words and phrases.


Then, during the reading phase of the Haggadah, individuals would pass around the printed script and the painstakingly assembled and sorted deck. When a blank appeared in the script, the reader would pause, {{ take a conspicuous action // quack like a duck // She would __ // blow trumpets }}, read the next answer from the deck, put it on the bottom of the deck, keep reading the script, and repeat the cycle when the next blank appeared.


This new incarnation of Mad Liberation is a virtual, tech-enabled, disruptive, {{ tech buzz word //  Big Data //  // industry-leading }} version of that. I think you get it.

## More information about Passover
By the way, if you’re not Jewish, or if you’re Jewish and you’re so young you haven’t been to a Passover seder, or if you’re just {{ a person who doesn’t know anything // // // a silly fool }}, you may be feeling a little confused right now.


Passover is a holiday. Like {{ a holiday // // That day is __. // Pentecost }}. It involves gathering with friends and/or family at a party called a seder.


At this seder, the friends and family come prepared with certain items. These items are placed on a seder plate and explained. The explanation of the items, and the explanation of the history, meaning, and significance of Passover, is scripted. The script is called a Haggadah.
