# madliberation-itest

Browser-based demo of the [Mad Liberation](https://passover.lol) web app.

Run this with:

```
$ npx madliberation-itest --slow
```

That will launch a GUI browser and show two people playing Mad Liberation.

The main script is at [App.itest.js](https://github.com/douglasnaphas/madliberation-itest/blob/master/App.itest.js).
